FlyBoy flight simulator
-----------------------

A very simple fly-the-ship-through-the-maze game.

Works on the flipdot controller.

Controls (input to terminal):
	- movement: arrows left, right, up, down
	- shoot: 't', 'z', 'g', 'q' (or ' ')
	- quit: 'Q'
	- instant reset: '565'
	- explode: '5678'

Usage:
	$ ./flyboy /dev/ttyACM0

(or whatever tty device got attached)

For use with the flipdot-simulator:
- start the simulator
- use the "tty_interface" fifo in the directory where the simulator is started
