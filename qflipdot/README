Flipdot simulator
-----------------

Creates a flipdot screen of 20x120 flipdots and is controlled as the OSAA
flipdot controller. The interface is a fifo (named pipe), which is created in
the current directory (where you start the simulator) under the name
"tty_interface".

The simulator limits the number of flips per second to about 3000 to simulate
real-world limitations of the hardware.


Usage
-----
- start the simulator in the background
	$ ./qflipdot &
- run flyboy (or any other app you make)
	$ ../flyboy/flyboy ./tty_interface

Attaching and detaching from the fifo is handled by the simulator. No need to
restart the simulator if the driving app is restarted.


Protocol
--------
- two bytes are read on the fifo for each pixel
	* byte 1 - X-coordinate + on/off in bit 7
	* byte 2 - Y-coordinate
- coordinates are zero-based

If you run the the bytes out of sequence, anything may happen, just not what
you expect.
